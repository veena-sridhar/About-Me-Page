			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>I just graduated with a degree in Chemistry. I can finally say that I understand why people keep saying that college was the best time in their lives. It was tons of fun! But once I started working, I realized that the biotech industry really didn't suit any of my interests. After that, I resolved to make a career change.
			<br />
			<br />
			I'm extremely passionate about trying completely new things, and creating great art. Front-end development seems like the perfect hybrid between my science background and artistic inclinations. I'm really excited to see myself get better at this!</p>

			<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
			<p>I was born in Columbia, South Carolina, but when I was very young, my family moved to Silicon Valley, CA. Since I was raised in California, I grew up just as spoiled in terms of the weather as every other Californian out there. For college, I moved to sunny San Diego, CA, and ended up with a BS in Chemistry from UC San Diego.
			<br />
			<br />
			Two weeks after graduation, I started working at Hologic, a biotech company in San Diego. Though the work hasn't quite piqued my interest, I keep myself fulfilled by learning new things outside of work.</p>

			<h1>More About Me</h1>
			<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
				<p>I love playing sports! Volleyball, tennis, swimming, and dodgeball are some of my favorite activities. When I'm not doing any of those things, you can always find me hanging out with friends and family, playing chess, or trying to learn some new form of art.</p>
			<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
				<p>My dream job would need to have three main characteristics: (1) let me use my skills to do something useful and creative, (2) allow me to learn new things, and (3) make me think. If a job had all of these, I would be really happy. But of course, if I could be my own boss, I would be much happier. ;)</p>
			<h2>What are your career plans?</h2>
				<p>As far as my career is concerned, I would definitely like to start working as a front-end developer for a major corporation sometime in the near future. I also really like to learn new things, so when it's possible, I'd like to get certified in interior design, and possibly become a freelance designer for that as well. I want my career to take me in all kinds of directions and give me a taste of many fields throughout my life.</p>
			<h2>What kind of music do you like?</h2>
				<p>Lots! Maroon 5 is easily one of my favorites to listen to. Apart from mainstream music, I really love jazz, 80's music, and any compositions from musical theater.</p>
